      Ethereum, being the first world computer, has spurred a&nbsp;cambrian
      explosion of
      <span title="decentralized apps" style="cursor: help">dApps</span>
      . Yet its capacity is limited&nbsp;&mdash; when gas prices surge,
      high-transaction-volume use-cases and low-value transactions are pushed
      off&nbsp;the&nbsp;chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      LeapDAO exist to create and maintain an execution environment to host
      these use-cases, by this increasing the capacity of Ethereum and widening
      the scope of&nbsp;possible Dapps in the Ethereum ecosystem.
