We are releasing an updated dev roadmap. The idea is that it should help existing dev team to stay focused on Plasma Leap PoC and Leap Network needs and help newcomers to see what's on the plate.

Check it out, if you are curious what we are busy with nowadays or if you are a Solidity or Node.js developer looking for a work in a (hopefully) bullshit-free project. In the latter case, you might also be interested to read [how we work](https://github.com/leapdao/meta/wiki/Onboarding).
