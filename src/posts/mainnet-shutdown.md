description: Leap Mainnet on hold, here is why...
---
The leap network is restructuring, we explore new technologies & upgrade the testnet.

Plasma is here to bundle up transactions, and submit them to the mainnet in the form of periods, rather than blocks. Plasma enables fast transactions at a fraction of the cost.

The Ethereum Foundation awarded LeapDAO a grant to design and launch a working plasma chain, in order to tool up Ethereum with scalability.

Next to it, LeapDAO grew as a fully distributed team. Organised and equipped with holacratic principles, the team managed to realise a fully working plasma chain in 2 years.

## Restructuring LeapDAO
After working hard on implementing Plasma on Layer2, the team recognised a trend towards new and exciting technologies and decided to move one step forward.

Let's focus on DApp development and provide the infrastructure for all DApp projects willing to work on Ethereum. Next to Plasma there are other second layer solutions which offer a wide range of solutions already.

The new approach is finding the right solution for the right project.

## Research in Rollups
LeapDAO made their homework and has started to research in optimistic roll-ups & zK roll-ups. After getting familiar with the "new kids on the block", the team explores how to combine roll-ups with plasma knowledge and create a new powerful dark matter to scale Ethereum even further!

During the research it became obvious that every protocol is special and needs a custom solution in order to gain traction. Therefore the plasma chain will still be an interesting approach for specific scalable zero-knowledge proofs.

## Improved development, on the testnet
At the moment the leap mainnet is under construction. We concentrate our efforts on the functionality and reliability of the testnet.

The testnet is ready to get some traffic, and all products can be tested, before getting launched on main. It will all fall into place, once the brain/code work is done.

Soon, there will be a return of the mainnet with improved features and a variety of new updates. Maintaining a mainnet demands various resources: effort, money & manpower. All of these are rare and hard to obtain...

## Hard facts & the next steps
The official mainnet shutdown is expected for the 7st of March 2020. Until then, the Leap Plasma chain is in operation and working. In full [holacracy fashion](https://leapdao.org/blog/Minimal-Viable-Governance/), a governance proposal will be submitted, to enable the next proceedings.

Leap Plasma contracts will be upgraded and unclaimed funds are recovered, in order to distribute them to their respective owners via root-chain. Further deposits are not allowed.

Once the contract upgrades are finalized, the actual shutdown is done by stopping all the Leap Mainnet validator nodes and all the related infrastructure. Funds are withdrawn & returned.

**--> If you have any funds on Leap Mainnet, please make sure to withdraw them. <--**

As our mainnet pause is starting within the next 2 weeks, we advise you to take action and exit your funds.

You can do that very easy over here: https://mainnet.leapdao.org

Please remember: the exit takes 7 days to finalize.

## Following our purpose and driving for mass adaption
Whatever is the way we go and which technologies we adopt, the team is motivated to work towards our common purpose:

"Help collectives of people to collaborate on things they care about and achieve sovereignty in a non-violent and fulfilling way."

The aim is to preserve our decentralised & fully-distributed team, get some engines running and help the crypto/ethereum ecosystem achieving mass-adoption.
