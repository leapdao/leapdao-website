Until recently, applying Plasma solutions to real life problems seemed like a far away endeavour, but already now it’s slowly and steadily becoming reality. Beginning with pop up economies at ETH Denver and [Blocksplit](https://leapdao.org/blog/SunDAI-power-Blocksplit-2019/), we saw Plasma’s and Burner Wallet’s potential in creating a cashless society. Now, we moved onto an even more interesting and excited challenge! 

Last week the LeapDAO team has joined two other blockchain projects - [Cinemarket](https://www.cinemarket.io/) and [White Rabbit](https://whiterabbit.one/) at the Cannes Film Festival (yes.. the famous annual red carpet situation) to demonstrate the potential of utilizing blockchain to professionalize peer-to-peer streaming, while capturing value in the film industry and distributing it to producers and rights holders. The presented solution enabled film rights holders to maximize the exploitation of their assets in more territories and allows streaming sites to open new revenue streams.


Our project partners propose to embrace and professionalize peer-to-peer streaming with blockchain. Cinemarket is a secure online transaction platform enabling license owners to sell their film directly to distributors and exhibitors, while White Rabbit provides a browser plug-in which recognizes streamed content. Their founders realize that we are at a crucial point in time for the future of film, and it is vital to have a film industry that owns its digital distribution through technology, rather than the tech industry pushing the film industry to one side, and monopolizing the production space. 


At the Cannes Film Festival last week, we wanted to test in action a market connecting movie producers and right owners with their audience in a peer-to-peer manner. To that purpose, we prepared a demo in which movie rightowners could register the film rights and licenses on the blockchain as NFTs.  Tokens were minted on a plasma chain and they could be moved to mainnet later (ERC 1949), while spending conditions (smart contracts on Plasma) were used to distribute payments according to token data (ERC 1948).

Rights holders were able to register their right to an existing production and set their addresses by scanning QR code. They scanned a private key to launch rightsholder wallet (adapted Burner Wallet) and provide an address for payment. 

From the streamers perspective, the demo featured a streaming site working with the decentralized rights registry and a movie browser. After 10 seconds of streaming a browser plugin popped up asking the viewer to contribute to the rights holders of the particular movie. The plugin had a prefunded wallet and allowed the user to pay for the stream ($2). When the transfer was sent, the streamer was able to continue to watch the movie while the wallet of the rights holder received the payment within 2-3 seconds. You can view the entire demo flowin this [presentation deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QabUcFLZQLx3VS9e-QRiF-EmTk5tYjbiII-zlROVC4Q). 

The demo participants were movie producers and rights holders who came to Cannes and didn’t have much previous experience with crypto. Collecting payments for streams has sparked many discussions among them. The mostly non-technical audience was impressed by the easy of onboarding and the speed of transfers.

Our Cannes demo aimed to show the ease, speed and transparency of payments from content consumers to rights holders. Thanks to this solution, producers are no longer disconnected from their audience, keep the rights of their production, and tap into a wide new market. Peer-to-peer streaming, illegal so far, can now be monetized. We hope that this industry-changing demo utilizing Plasma at the Cannes Film Festival will prove that professionalizing peer-to-peer streaming can unlock huge rewards for both fans and rights holders. We’re happy that LeapDAO is able to power these efforts with our Plasma-based infrastructure.
