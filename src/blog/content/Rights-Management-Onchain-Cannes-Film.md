Our Cannes demo aimed to show the ease, speed and transparency of payments from content consumers to rights holders. Thanks to this solution, producers are no longer disconnected from their audience, keep the rights of their production, and tap into a wide new market. Peer-to-peer streaming, illegal so far, can now be monetized. We hope that this industry-changing demo utilizing Plasma at the Cannes Film Festival will prove that professionalizing peer-to-peer streaming can unlock huge rewards for both fans and rights holders. We’re happy that LeapDAO is able to power these efforts with our Plasma-based infrastructure.
