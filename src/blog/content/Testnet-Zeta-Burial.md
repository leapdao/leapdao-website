It's name is Testnet Zeta and it is a Plasma chain with 57002 blocks. It's name is Testnet Zeta, and Testnet Zeta will have 57002 blocks forever.

Born on February 1th, Zeta was the first our testnet we challenged invalid plasma exit on, the first testnet we claimed period rewards from. It was the first to operate fast exit market maker, buying back plasma exits. It was the first we publicly announced. Some folks even registered their tokens on it — sorry guys, you should have really used them.

Zeta survived extortion by Steven Pearce's watchtower and Evgenii's performance tests.

One minute, Zeta was the warm center that the life of LeapDAO crowded around, and the next moment, it was a pile of code. After the Pinkiebell's spending condition shot, the amazing miracle of consensus failure.
