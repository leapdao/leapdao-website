description: Our Plasma Testnet launched on Rinkeby running the Driftwood release. üéâ
---

Today we are proud to reveal our first public deployment of a Plasma Network. Testnet Zeta has anchored its first Plasma block in the Rinkeby network on Friday and is since then available for the public to use and test. It runs the [0.5 Driftwood Release](https://test.leapdao.org/blog/Plasma-Roadmap/) of the leap-contracts and leap-node code and brings the following features:

- A More Viable Plasma network built on Tendermint.
- Single Plasma operator run by LeapDAO community.
- Ability to transfer ERC20/ERC721 tokens.
- Contract upgrades secured by Minimal Viable Governance.

The 0.5 Driftwood Release is the first step on the LeapDAO roadmap to launch a public Plasma network supporting provable computations. You can read more about our development proposition in [the whitepaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vStTjqvqZGyiI5AVtpwCIMlHFnzC_4bbixsCfs27-M8).

No matter if you are a cryptocurrency user or a developer, there is something for you in this release:

### For users:
- Get some tokens from the [testnet faucet](http://testnet.leapdao.org/faucet).
- [Deposit and transfer](http://testnet.leapdao.org/wallet) some tokens. Transfers will happen on the Leap Network, free and fast. You can also try out our [mobile wallet alpha](https://github.com/leapdao/mobile-plasma-wallet).
- Download and [synchronize a Plasma node](https://github.com/leapdao/leap-node) to check the validity of the chain and security of your funds.
- Keep an eye on [recent governance proposals](http://testnet.leapdao.org/governance) that may change security assumptions.
- [Exit](http://testnet.leapdao.org/wallet) your tokens back to the root chain.

### For developers:
- Request your [token to be registered](http://testnet.leapdao.org/registerToken) on the network. The token will receive a ‚Äúcolor‚Äù and deposits and exits will be enabled for it.
- Download and [synchronize a Plasma node](https://github.com/leapdao/leap-node), or use our infrastructure at `http://node1.testnet.leapdao.org:8645` to query the [JSON RPC](https://docs.leapdao.org/json-rpc/overview/).
- Check out [the documentation](http://docs.leapdao.org) on how to query the chain and send transactions.
