---

We are proud to reveal our first public deployment of a Plasma Network. Testnet Zeta has anchored its first Plasma block in the Rinkeby network on Friday, and since then has become available for the public use and testing. It runs the [0.5 Driftwood Release](https://test.leapdao.org/blog/Plasma-Roadmap/) of the [leap-contracts](https://github.com/leapdao/leap-contracts/releases/tag/v0.2.2) and [leap-node](https://github.com/leapdao/leap-node) code, and brings the following features:

- A [More Viable Plasma](https://www.learnplasma.org/en/learn/mvp.html) network built on [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/).
- Single Plasma operator run by the LeapDAO community.
- Ability to transfer ERC20/ERC721 tokens.
- Contract upgrades secured by [Minimal Viable Governance](/blog/Minimal-Viable-Governance/).

The 0.5 Driftwood Release is the first step on the [LeapDAO roadmap](https://test.leapdao.org/blog/Plasma-Roadmap/) to launch a public Plasma network supporting provable computations. You can read more about our development proposition in [the whitepaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vStTjqvqZGyiI5AVtpwCIMlHFnzC_4bbixsCfs27-M8).

The release is packed with goodies for blockchain users and dApp developers. Here is a shortlist of features:

### For users:
- Get some tokens from the [testnet faucet](http://testnet.leapdao.org/faucet).
- [Deposit and transfer](http://testnet.leapdao.org/wallet) your tokens. Transfers will take place on the Leap Network, in a free and fast manner. You can also try out our [mobile wallet alpha](https://github.com/leapdao/mobile-plasma-wallet).
- Download and [synchronize a Plasma node](https://github.com/leapdao/leap-node) to check the validity of the chain and the security of your funds.
- Keep an eye on [recent governance proposals](http://testnet.leapdao.org/governance) that may change security assumptions.
- [Exit](http://testnet.leapdao.org/wallet) your tokens back to the root chain.

### For developers:
- Request your [token to be registered](http://testnet.leapdao.org/registerToken) on the network. The token will receive a ‚Äúcolor‚Äù, and deposits and exits will be enabled for it.
- Download and [synchronize a Plasma node](https://github.com/leapdao/leap-node), or use our infrastructure at `http://node1.testnet.leapdao.org:8645` to query the [JSON RPC](https://docs.leapdao.org/json-rpc/overview/).
- Check out [the documentation](http://docs.leapdao.org) on how to query the chain and send transactions. 


If you are curious to know more about the project, read more about us on the [website](https://leapdao.org/) and follow us on [twitter](https://twitter.com/leapdao). We would love üíõto see more of you getting involved in LeapDAO. We are looking for like-minded people (not only developers ;)).
