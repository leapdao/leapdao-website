## Burner Wallet on Leap Network TL;DR
The Burner wallet works in any mobile web browser so no app download or wallet setup are required. The [SunDAI instance](https://sundai.io) is running on the [Leap Network](https://mainnet.leapdao.org), a Plasma chain created by the [LeapDAO community](https://leapdao.org) and providing block times of 2-4 seconds. SunDAI is pegged to the dollar so there is low cognitive overhead. The best part is onboarding is as easy as opening your camera.

## User Flow 

The Blocksplit conference ran over 2 days on April 25 to 26 and hosted ~150 participants in the beautiful town of Split, Croatia. Attendees received a paper wallet at registration with an amount of SunDAI according to their ticket type.

This Paper Wallet had an Ethereum private key in the form of a QR code inside. An attendee could pull out their phone‚Äôs camera and point it at the QR to spawn a wallet.

The scan does both, load the wallet website and import the key that is pre-loaded with some amount of tokens. For the user this means that hurdles like app download and securing seed phrases are not needed and the onboarding into crypto is instant.

From there the attendees could approach the different vendors, scan a QR code and pay. The payment arrived seconds later and could be verified by the vendors on the tablets.
