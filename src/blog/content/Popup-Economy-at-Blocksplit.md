The first pop-up economy powered by Plasma!

## Burner Wallet on Leap Network TL;DR
The Burner wallet works in any mobile web browser so no app download or wallet setup are required. The [SunDAI instance](https://sundai.io) is running on the [Leap Network](https://mainnet.leapdao.org), a Plasma chain created by the [LeapDAO community](https://leapdao.org) and providing block times of 2-4 seconds. SunDAI is pegged to the dollar so there is low cognitive overhead. The best part is onboarding is as easy as opening your camera.

## User Flow 

The Blocksplit conference ran over 2 days on April 25 to 26 and hosted ~150 participants in the beautiful town of Split, Croatia. Attendees received a paper wallet at registration with an amount of SunDAI according to their ticket type.

This Paper Wallet had an Ethereum private key in the form of a QR code inside. An attendee could pull out their phone‚Äôs camera and point it at the QR to spawn a wallet.

The scan does both, load the wallet website and import the key that is pre-loaded with some amount of tokens. For the user this means that hurdles like app download and securing seed phrases are not needed and the onboarding into crypto is instant.

From there the attendees could approach the different vendors, scan a QR code and pay. The payment arrived seconds later and could be verified by the vendors on the tablets.

Attendees could also recharge their wallets with DAI or Ether by using the exchange view. The SunDAI contract was set up in a way that it would pull DAI in as a collateral to mint new SunDAI, and users that had topped up with DAI where also whitelisted to offboard SunDAI into DAI.

  ```

If attendees did not bring any of their own crypto then [Bitcoin Store](https://www.bitcoin-store.hr/) provided a fiat exchange right at the event. 

## Merchant Stats

Offboarding in the Plasma design takes unconvenient 3,5 to 7 days. To keep merchants and users happy we operated a [Fast Exit Market Maker](https://github.com/leapdao/exit-market-maker) throughout the event. This marker maker would buy pending exits from users and pay them out immediately. 

## Summary

In **total 1135 SunDAI transfers** have been made during the 2 days of the conference. In this time the Plasma chain has submitted 106 anchors to the Ethereum mainnet paying a **total of USD 7.23 in transaction fees**.


We want to thank Antea, Lorena and Luka, our enthusiastic volunteers helping with the burner Wallet as well as to Tomo and Bruno for inviting us to the event and giving us the opportunity demo the tech.
