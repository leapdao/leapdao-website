Hey Peeps!

You might remember us becoming [EF grantees](https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/05/02/announcing-may-2018-cohort-ef-grants/) in May this year. The objective was to contribute to Plasma research and come up with a secure and scalable way to run Dapps on Plasma.

Well, guess what?! We have delivered on all milestones and are able to demonstrate the outcomes. Please find details attached in the following reports, a paper, and demos:

## Deliverables

- **[Plasma Leap](https://goo.gl/h8Th6d) -** a write-up of our research results as [full paper](https://goo.gl/tm9JWA).
- **Demo of Dapps on Plasma -** a dashboard for the Plasma chain as well as 2 Dapps running on a testnet:
  - [BridgeUI](http://stake-dev.parseclabs.org), a dashboard for Plasma users and operators:
    [demo video](https://youtu.be/ZnRlcZErTc4).
  - [Project Alice](http://alice.parseclabs.org), a Plasma sandbox wallet: [demo video](https://youtu.be/AzD-Lknye78).
  - [Rock-Paper-Scissors game](https://goo.gl/Rgr662): [demo video](https://youtu.be/lYRurlnTcLk).
- **[Milestone Report and Budget Report](https://goo.gl/HxXfWe) -** discussion of milestones and breakdown of budget.

With [Plasma Leap](https://goo.gl/h8Th6d) we hope to have considerably widened the scope of decentralized applications that can be implemented on layers-2 scaling solutions. We have plans to continue development and bring the technology to main-net. Expect more details in our upcoming roadmap blog post.
